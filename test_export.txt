Title: Python (programming language)

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability through significant indentation, and is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected, supporting multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. The language was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, with Python 3.0, released in 2008, being a major revision that was not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. The language has continued to evolve, with capabilities and keywords for typing added starting with Python 3.5, allowing for optional static typing, and as of 2026, the Python Software Foundation supports versions 3.10 through 3.14, following an annual release cycle and five-year support policy. Python has become widely used in the machine learning community and is often taught as an introductory programming language, consistently ranking in the top ten of the TIOBE Programming Community Index since 2003, based on searches across 24 platforms.
